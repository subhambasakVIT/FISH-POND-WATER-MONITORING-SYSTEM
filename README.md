# FISH-POND-WATER-MONITORING-SYSTEM
The Fish Pond Water Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution using an ESP32 to monitor temperature, pH, turbidity, and TDS. Sensor data is sent to ThingSpeak for real-time visualization. A buzzer alerts when temperature exceeds safe limits. This cost-effective system automates aquaculture, reduces manual effort, and boosts fish productivity.
